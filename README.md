## Introduction

Data structures and algorithms are essential components of computer science that enable efficient data storage, retrieval, and manipulation. This repository contains implementations of various data structures (like arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, etc.) and algorithms (such as sorting, searching, greedy algorithms, etc.).

The goal of this repository is to provide clear and concise implementations that are easy to understand, making it a great resource for learning and reference.

## Languages Used
- C
- Python
- SQL
- Others (Feel free to contribute!)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the code in this repository, you will need to have the relevant programming languages installed on your system. For example, to run Python scripts, you'll need Python installed.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/PedroThezi/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms.git
2. **Navigate to the repository:**
   ```sh
   cd Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
3. **Run the code:**
Navigate to the relevant language folder, and run the desired script using the appropriate command.

#### Exemple
**For example, to run a C implementation of array:**
 ```sh
   cd Array
   gcc array.c -o array
   .\array
 ```
